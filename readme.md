# Weather App
This is a simple weather application built with React that provides current weather information for a given location. It utilizes an external API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

# Features
Current Weather: The app displays the current weather conditions for a specified location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

# Search:
 Users can search for weather information for a specific location by entering the city name or zip code. The app fetches the weather data for the provided location and updates the display accordingly.

# Responsive Design:
 The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

# Installation
To run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Emmanuel687/Weather-Focus.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd weather-app
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Obtain an API key from a weather data provider. You can use providers such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, or any other weather API of your choice. Once you have the API key, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key:

REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
Start the development server:

npm start
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the Weather App in action.

# Configuration
The app uses environment variables to store configuration settings. Currently, the only required configuration is the API key, which should be set in the .env file as mentioned in the installation steps.

# Technologies Used
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Axios: A promise-based HTTP client used to make API requests.

CSS: Styling the app for an enhanced user interface.

API Usage
The Weather App relies on an external weather API to fetch weather data. The API used can be configured in the .env file, and you can use any weather API of your choice by updating the API endpoint and request parameters in the code.
